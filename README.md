#### we will track our data by using DVC :- data version control 
- we will track our data store in our artifacts folder 
- usually we have to big data so we can put them in CI or it is not posible we store our bigdata in our repository  
- we have to control that data so we track our file (artifact file ) by using DVC 
- as git has command DVC also have the command 
    -- to initiallize dvc --> dvc init  
       you get .dvc folder and .devcignore file -> in that you get more folder we will not commit it our main git tht'y 
- inside .dvc folder our data tracking happend  
- .devcignore inside 

- first we have to untrack artifacts folder file for next to track it y dvc
